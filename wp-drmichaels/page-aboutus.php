                                                        <p>With a passion for dentistry, <a href="#">Dr. Michael Formenius</a> started Dr. Michael’s Dental Clinic in Sweden in 1982 spanning five dental centres and a dental laboratory across Stockholm. Focused on his vision of providing outstanding services in dentistry, Dr. Michael expanded to the UAE, where he currently runs three state-of- the-art multispecialty dental clinics. All three are located along Al Wasl Road (Jumeirah and Umm Suqeim), popularly known as the “The Harley Street of Dubai”.</p>
                                                        <p>Since its birth in Dubai in 1997, Dr. Michael’s Dental Clinic has built an enviable place in the industry as one of the most trusted dental healthcare providers in the region.</p>
