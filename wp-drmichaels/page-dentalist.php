                                                                        <p>To date, there has not been one valid, scientific evidence linking root canal-treated teeth and disease elsewhere in the body. The American Association of Endodontists (AAE) states that there is no causality between root canals and cancer; just because a person has experienced both doesn’t mean a cause-and-effect relationship exists.</p>
                                                                        <p>In fact, a 2013 study published in a journal of the <a href="#" target="_blank">American Medical Association</a> (JAMA Otolaryngology—Head &amp; Neck Surgery) found that a patient’s risk of cancer doesn’t change after having a root canal treatment. Additionally, researchers found that patients with multiple endodontic treatments had a 45% reduced risk of cancer.</p>
                                                                        <p class="quote bg-blue"><i class="uk-icon-info-circle"></i> Researchers found that patients with multiple endodontic treatments had a 45% <strong>reduced</strong> risk of cancer.</p>
